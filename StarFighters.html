               This is a two-player game that I made in my second year of the GIMM program. The goal of the game is to destroy the other player's mothership while defending your own. The gameplay itself is really fun, and everyone I played it with really enjoyed the game. I would love to expand on this concept in the future.

                  This first script controls the AI of the mothership, allowing it to target the enemy player and send volleys of lasers at them.

                  This script controlled the camera in the game. At first, it was a challenge to keep both players and their motherships on the same screen at the same time. I tried using Unity's built-in system for this, but it didn't work as well as I wanted it to. So, I made my own system and got the results I wanted.

                  This is gameplay footage of the game I made with my roommate. As you can see, the graphics leave something to be desired, but the gameplay is fast-paced and fun to play.
