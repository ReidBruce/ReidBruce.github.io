                This is the first game I ever made in the GIMM program. It is a 2D bullet hell game that was heavily inspired by the game Enter the Gungeon, which to this day is still one of my favorite games. This was not my first Unity project, but it was, at the time, the largest project I had ever attempted to make. Some of the things I am most proud of in this game are the level-up mechanic, where you purchase upgrades for your weapon using currency dropped by enemies, and the final boss, which I was extremely proud of.

                   This is code from the boss. I reused code from one of my enemies and made it much more difficult for the player by making him shoot more bullets, fire faster, and giving him much more health.

                   This is code from my dash mechanic that allowed the player to become immune to damage while dashing. It is the only way to dodge bullets. My only regret is that the animation for dashing was not very good.
