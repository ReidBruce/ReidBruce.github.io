                    This is an image I made during my first year in the GIMM program. The assignment was to find a structure outdoors (a building, tree, landscape, etc.) and draw it as if it were in another world. I had noticed a cool-looking amphitheater outside my dorm and thought, "This could be a cool place for gladiators to fight." And the rest is history.

                    This is an image of the first boss I ever created in a game. The goal of the game was to navigate a dungeon and defeat the enemies along the way. At the end of the dungeon, I wanted a boss and thought, "What could be scarier and more challenging than a boss made of shotguns?" If you want to see this guy in action, check out the Projects page and watch the game trailer!

                    This is an image of a portal I made for my interactive comic book. Our prompt for the comic book was "Quantum Entanglement," and we had to create a story to go along with it. I wouldn't say it's my best project, but it definitely looked the best out of anything else I have created so far.

                    This video was for our green screen assignment where we used Adobe Premiere to edit a video of ourselves. I worked way too hard on this one because I had a vision of myself dunking on the devil, and I was going to make that happen. I think this is the funniest project I've ever made.

                    This is a spaceship I created in my first Blender assignment. We made this just to learn the basics of Blender, but I have actually used this model in a couple of different projects.
