    <h1>Reid Bruce</h1>
    <p>Hello! I'm Reid Bruce, a Game/Web Programmer. Welcome to my portfolio website, where I showcase my skills,
        projects, and experiences.

        I was born in Woodinville, Washington, and currently reside in Boise, Idaho, where I attend college at Boise
        State University. My dream in life is to create experiences that people will remember forever, whether through
        video games or other forms of media.

        Currently, I am a student in Boise State's GIMM program (Games, Interactive Media, and Mobile), where I am
        learning multiple industry-standard skills and programs that will help me achieve that dream.
